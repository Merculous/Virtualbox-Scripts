# make_macos_vm

This was only tested enough on a Linux machine.

Windows was tested but the arguments dealing with paths are broken for now.
I will fix this in a bit.

MacOS should be almost the same as Linux so it should work in theory.

As for the script itself, I need to figure out how to properly set the
networking bit as that changes per device.
